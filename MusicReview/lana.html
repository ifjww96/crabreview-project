                            The follow-up to Born to Die finds Lana Del Rey in ballad mode, finding new synergy between
                            the character she presents to the world and the content of the songs. Producer Dan Auerbach
                            of Black Keys turns out to be the perfect creative partner.</em>
                    </h5>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>
                        Lana Del Rey, the creation of singer and songwriter Lizzy Grant, is all alone. She’s an utterly
                        distinctive figure in popular music—not part of a scene, with no serious imitators—and befitting
                        someone completely off on her own, she’s lonely. Where her last full-length, the frequently
                        terrible Born to Die, tried on different moods and looked at her character from a few angles,
                        Ultraviolence finds one feeling—a seedy, desperate, hyper-romanticized sense of isolation and
                        loss—and blows it up to drive-in screen proportions, saturating the color riding the blue crest
                        of sadness for the better part of an hour. Whether or not you want to take this particular ride
                        will largely depend on how much stock you put in “authenticity,” your tolerance for Del Rey’s
                        vocal tics, and your reflexive response to her lyrics.
                        <br><br>
                        Creating a semi-fictional delivery system for your creative ideas is nothing new, but few have
                        had Del Rey’s commitment to the idea—imagine Madonna sticking with Breathless Mahoney for
                        multiple album cycles. This far in, after so many interviews and so much media attention, we
                        don’t know all that much about Lana Del Rey, and we’re not sure what we’re told is real. She’s
                        become a screen onto which we project our desire and/or our loathing. With Ultraviolence, Del
                        Rey has found new synergy between the character she presents to the world and the content of the
                        songs.
                        <br><br>
                        Gone are annoying trifles like Born to Die’s “Carmen” and “Diet Mountain Dew”; in their place
                        are slow, atmospheric songs filled with theatrical melancholy and a parade of women in trouble
                        who mourn for men who treat them badly yet somehow remain irresistible. The lyrics are studded
                        with her trademark iconography: “he hit me and it felt like a kiss”; “the sun also rises”;
                        “talking about my generation”; a reference to “Sunset and Vine” and another to “strange
                        weather.” But here she’s found the perfect musical vehicle for her vision. Ultraviolence sounds
                        tragic and beautiful—darkly-shaded ballads are what she was created to make, and this album is
                        nothing but, a Concept Album from a Concept Human.
                        <br><br>
                        The first section of the album is so gorgeous and rich, Ultraviolence at first seems better than
                        it is. The Black Keys’ Dan Auerbach, who produced much of the record, turns out to be Del Rey's
                        ideal creative partner, crafting lush walls of sound that evoke her favorite cultural era, a
                        time when the prim and surface-level 1960s were just starting their slide into drug-fueled
                        decadence. “Cruel World” is a six-minute dirge that 30 years ago might have been sung by Bonnie
                        Tyler, its twangy guitars and thudding drums exploding at just the right moments. The title
                        track’s gorgeous chorus dresses up a song where love and physical abuse are intertwined. Del
                        Rey’s angelic interval leap on the chorus of “Shades of Cool” is a new addition to her small
                        array of vocal effects, bringing to mind the faux-Asian sweep of Nancy Sinatra’s “You Only Live
                        Twice” mixed with the song that lured the prince in Disney’s Sleeping Beauty. They’re songs that
                        would make no sense if anyone else sang them. In this way, and a few others, she draws
                        inspiration from rap music, broadcasting her obsessions and forcing you to engage with the
                        persona first and the content of the songs second.
                        <br><br>
                        It’s an impressive opening shot, and there are a few moments in this sequence that make you want
                        to sit back and say, “Hold on, is this for real?” But then comes “Brooklyn Baby”, a song that
                        references Lou Reed, a rare jazz collection, feathers in hair, the “freedom land of the ’70s,”
                        and “churning out novels like beat poetry on amphetamines.” Is Del Rey taking the piss, making
                        fun of lifestyle accessories as a source of identity? Or is she celebrating these icons, the way
                        she has so many others, reveling in the colorful tapestry that is American popular culture?
                        <br><br>
                        Turns out these are the wrong questions. When lines like these pop up on the record, I find
                        myself chuckling, sometimes laughing out loud, which might seem odd on an album about sadness.
                        But that says something about how strange Del Rey's music can be, and the internal coherence of
                        the worlds she creates. These songs don’t ask you to respond in any particular way; they evoke
                        heartbreak one moment and they’re ridiculous the next, and those qualities don’t cancel each
                        other out. It’s entertainment, camp, and the ambiguity of it all, nurtured by the cool distance
                        of Lana Del Rey’s image, is a huge part of the music’s appeal. Those who really hate what she’s
                        about—and there are a lot of these people—look for something in music that she has no interest
                        in providing. To enjoy what she does, you have to give yourself over to her media-saturated
                        fantasy and put the everyday on hold, and you also have to lay aside pop radio’s typically sunny
                        affirmations.
                        <br><br>
                        But this thing Lana Del Rey is going for isn’t easy to sustain, and it starts to go south during
                        the back half of Ultraviolence. The album grows tiresome somewhere during the stretch where
                        “Pretty When You Cry” leads to “Money Power Glory” and then on to “Fucked My Way Up to the Top”.
                        The melodies are a little less interesting and, instead of melodramatic fables, she settles for
                        button-pushing. It’s also wearying to spend this much time in the presence of this particular
                        character. The masochism, the self-hatred, the drugs, the emotional world filtered through the
                        tragic figures American teenagers are drawn to gets old. You can feel Lana Del Rey inching into
                        territory where she’s daring you not to like her, and by the time you get to the Ultraviolence
                        bonus track “Florida Kilos”, a Harmony Korine co-write that might as well be called Spring
                        Breakers: The Audiobook, you begin to remember why many people find the whole project repellant.
                        Still, it’d be wrong to overlook the many things Ultraviolence does well, and how sui generis
                        Lana Del Rey is. She’s a pop music original full-stop, and there are not nearly enough of those
                        around.
