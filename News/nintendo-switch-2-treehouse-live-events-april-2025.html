        <h1 class="news-title">Nintendo Announces Additional Switch 2 Events for April 3 and 4</h1>
        <img src="Image\nintendo-switch-2.png" alt="Nintendo Switch 2 Console" class="content-img">
        <div class="news-content">
            <p>Before the April 2 Nintendo Switch 2 Direct broadcast, Nintendo stated that two Nintendo Treehouse: Live
                events would be held on April 3 and 4, starting at 10:00 AM Eastern. The Nintendo Treehouse broadcasts
                will feature hands-on gameplay of some Switch 2 games, but what those are remains a mystery at the time
                of this writing.</p>

            <p>The news of the Nintendo Treehouse events is the latest entry in a busy week for the company. On March
                31, the Nintendo Today app revealed another look at the Switch 2's console and controller layouts, which
                showed how the system could be played in Handheld, Tabletop, and Docked modes. The image posted by
                Nintendo Today also showed one of the Switch 2 Joy-Con controllers lying on the side, which could
                reference the controller's assumed mouse-mode functionality. Further details about the Switch 2 console,
                including a potential release date and pricing, will be publicized during an April 2 Nintendo Direct.
            </p>

            <p>In the hours leading up to the highly anticipated Switch 2 Nintendo Direct episode, Nintendo confirmed
                that more events for the console will happen this week. On social media, Nintendo of America stated that
                two Nintendo Treehouse: Live broadcasts will air on April 3 and 4, starting each day at 10:00 AM
                Eastern. The Treehouse streams will share hands-on gameplay of some Switch 2 games, but what those games
                are remains a mystery. Nintendo did not state how long each Nintendo Treehouse broadcast would last, but
                past episodes have ranged from 30 to 90 minutes across the years. The April 4 episode of Nintendo
                Treehouse: Live will happen on the same day as the first Nintendo Switch 2 Experience in-person event in
                New York City, held at the Center415 venue in Manhattan.</p>

            <p>Given that a new Mario Kart game for the Switch 2 was confirmed during the January teaser video, it
                stands to reason that it may be shown off during the Nintendo Treehouse event. Though the original
                Switch will still see the release of games like Metroid Prime 4: Beyond and Pokemon Legends: Z-A, it
                remains to be seen if the Nintendo Treehouse broadcasts will show any backward-compatible Switch games
                running on Switch 2 or if exclusive titles will be the only focus.</p>

            <p>Between the hour-long Switch 2 Nintendo Direct and the Treehouse broadcasts, Nintendo fans will soon have
                more information to take in. Only time will tell what Nintendo will fully reveal across this week's
                streams.</p>
