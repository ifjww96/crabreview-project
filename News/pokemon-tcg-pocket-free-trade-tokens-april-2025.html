            class="content-img">
        <div class="news-content">
            <p>Pokemon TCG Pocket is rewarding its players with a large number of Trade Tokens. The mobile game has been
                a smash hit since the moment it launched, with its take on the popular TCG quickly accumulating over 100
                million downloads and sparking a surge in popularity for the Pokemon trading card hobby. Pokemon TCG
                Pocket lets players open up two packs of cards for free each day, battle other players in ranked and
                casual battles, trade, show off their collections, and more.</p>

            <p>Pokemon TCG Pocket added trading, a highly sought-after feature since the game launched, in January 2025.
                However, some fans found that trading was too costly, forcing players to gather a large amount of trade
                tokens by sacrificing their cards. Rarer and highly sought-after cards cost quite a lot of Trade Tokens,
                which has frustrated players trying to exchange them. The Pokemon Company acknowledged the complaints
                and announced on March 13 that they would be getting rid of trade tokens altogether, making Shinedust
                the main currency for trading. These big changes to trading in Pokemon TCG Pocket are expected to take
                place this fall, with extra Shinedust being awarded for each duplicate card acquired from booster packs.
            </p>

            <p>IOn April 1, Pokemon TCG Pocket sent every player 1,000 Trade Tokens courtesy of its development team,
                allowing them to trade a card of significant value essentially for free. Players can acquire the 1,000
                Trade Tokens by checking their Gift Box on the main menu. The news broke in a post on the official
                Pokemon TCG Pocket Twitter account early in the morning. This isn't the first time the development team
                has sent out Trade Tokens, as they have been slowly gifting players large amounts since they first
                announced changes to the system. In the future, Pokemon TCG Pocket getting rid of Trade Tokens may be
                healthy for the game, making it more accessible to trade cards with an easily acquirable currency.</p>

            <p>Pokemon TCG Pocket recently added Ranked Battles for players to enjoy high-stakes games with others. Fans
                can earn up to 100 Pack Hourglasses, cutting down the time to open up fresh packs. The rewards for
                Ranked Battles in Pokemon TCG Pocket have been very popular, with a Reddit post praising the rewards
                reaching over 1.8k upvotes. Finishing at Beginner Rank gives players 10 Pack Hourglasses, with this
                increasing by five every higher rank, ending up with 100 Pack Hourglasses after reaching the top 10,000
                in Master Ball rank.</p>

            <p>In-game artwork from the rare cards pulled from the title's original packs may soon be available in
                physical form for enthusiastic Pokemon fans. Physical merchandise for Pokemon TCG Pocket has been
                announced, with immersive cards getting their own "paper theaters." A TCG Pocket bag, keychain, and
                commemorative coins are also coming for Pokemon fans to purchase. The physical merchandise is expected
                to launch sometime soon in Japan, allowing fans to acquire 3D paper artwork of the Mewtwo EX, Pikachu
                EX, or Charizard EX immersive cards.</p>
