        <h1 class="news-title">Nintendo Reveals How Long the Switch 2 Direct Will Be</h1>
        <img src="Image\nintendo-switch-2-direct-how-long.png" alt="Nintendo Switch 2 Console" class="content-img">
        <div class="news-content">
            <p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Direct livestream is just around the corner, and Nintendo has revealed that the
                April 2 showcase will run for approximately 60 minutes. Gamers have been buzzing about the Nintendo
                Switch 2 ever since it was revealed back in January, with Nintendo itself promising more information in
                a dedicated Direct event. When the console was first shown off, it confirmed past rumors that it would
                retain the original Switch’s overall design, including the ability to be taken on the go through its
                special tablet mode.</p>

            <p>There are still a lot of mysteries surrounding the Nintendo Switch 2, and fans are hopeful that the
                impending Nintendo Direct will finally provide some answers ahead of the system's launch later this
                year. The livestream will hopefully reveal the exact release date for the Nintendo Switch 2, its price,
                and its launch lineup. So far, the only first-party game confirmed for the Switch 2 is a new Mario Kart,
                though there are rumors about a new 3D Mario title and a Zelda remake being in development for the new
                console.</p>

            <p>The upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 Direct will have plenty of time to answer these burning questions, as
                Nintendo has just confirmed that it will run for 60 minutes, according to IGN. The livestream will begin
                at 6 AM Pacific Time, 9 AM Eastern, and 10 PM British Summer Time. Nothing else was revealed about this
                week's Nintendo Direct at the time of writing.</p>

            <p>There are rumors that the Nintendo Switch 2 will be made available for pre-order on April 2 as well,
                though nothing has been confirmed yet. Nintendo recently gave fans another look at the Switch 2 and its
                updated Joy-Con controllers just a few short days before the big Nintendo Direct livestream,
                demonstrating once again that the new system will have all of the portable functionality of the original
                Switch. As for the cost of the Nintendo Switch 2, sources have claimed that the console could have a
                retail price in the range of $399 and $499.</p>

            <p>This is all currently just rumor and speculation, and it will likely stay that way until the Nintendo
                Switch 2 Direct livestream on April 2. That day is almost here, and fans now know how much time Nintendo
                will devote to showing off its newest hardware and upcoming games. With this Nintendo Direct clocking in
                at a full hour, it would be safe to guess that many of the questions fans still have about the Nintendo
                Switch 2 will finally be answered later this week.</p>
